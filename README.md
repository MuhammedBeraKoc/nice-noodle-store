A minimal API written in Express for noodle vendors
## About
In this project I have created a REST API for the vendors who think about founding a noodle shop. API has a lot of features. And it utilizes Swagger UI for testing and documenting http requests. For testing I have used `jest` and `supertest`. For the API building I chose `expressjs`.
